## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

     **Choosing Between Senior Quickbase Developer and AI Engineer: Pros & Cons**

     Deciding between becoming a Senior Quickbase Developer and an AI Engineer is a big career step. Let's break down the benefits and challenges of each path to help you make an informed choice.

     ---
     **Senior Quickbase Developer**

     *Pros:*
     - **Niche Expertise:** Quickbase is a specialized low-code platform. Mastery here gives you unique skills that certain organizations value for faster app development.
     - **Lower Barriers to Entry:** Low-code tools like Quickbase often require less formal education in traditional programming, making it more accessible.
     - **Rapid Development:** You can build and deploy solutions quickly, letting you see tangible results faster.
     - **Collaboration:** Expect frequent work with business users and cross-functional teams, growing your communication and business analysis skills.
     - **Stable Demand:** Many organizations rely on Quickbase for custom internal solutions, which can offer good job security.

     *Cons:*
     - **Limited Technical Growth:** You may not advance your deeper coding or computer science skills as much, since low-code environments handle much of the complexity.
     - **Platform Dependency:** Your skill set may become closely tied to Quickbase, making transitions to other roles or technologies harder.
     - **Business vs. Technical Focus:** The role may veer towards project or process management rather than pure software engineering, which isn't right for everyone.

     ---
     **AI Engineer**

     *Pros:*
     - **High Demand:** AI and machine learning expertise are increasingly sought after across industries.
     - **Innovative Work:** You get to work on the frontier of technology, creating impactful and often high-visibility solutions.
     - **Diverse Opportunities:** AI is used everywhere—from healthcare to finance to entertainment—so your skills are relevant in many fields.
     - **Higher Earning Potential:** Due to technical complexity and high demand, salaries are generally higher.
     - **Continuous Learning:** You'll regularly develop new skills in programming, data science, and mathematics.

     *Cons:*
     - **Steep Learning Curve:** Success requires strong programming, math, and statistical knowledge, which can take significant time and effort to develop.
     - **Rapid Evolution:** The field changes quickly, so ongoing self-education is essential.
     - **High Competition:** Many professionals and students are pursuing AI, which can make landing certain roles more competitive.

     ---
     **Summary & Questions for Reflection**

     As you weigh these paths, consider:
     - *Your Interests:* Do you like working closely with business teams and solving process problems (Quickbase)? Or are you excited about technical challenges and building smart systems (AI)?
     - *Career Goals:* Which role better fits your aspirations for leadership, salary, and skills?
     - *Work-Life Balance:* Consider the typical demands and hours in each field.
     - *Job Security & Growth:* Look at industry trends in your location or sector.

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes, the assistant's answers feel aligned with my communication style

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What does my schedule look like tomorrow?
   - Result: I'm unable to access your personal schedule or calendar. However, I can help you create an effective daily plan or suggest ways to structure your day!

   Here’s a simple template you can use to outline your schedule:

   **Daily Schedule Template**  
   Date: _[Insert Date Here]_

   **Morning**
   - 7:00 AM: Wake up
   - 7:30 AM: Breakfast
   - 8:00 AM: Morning exercise (jog, yoga, etc.)
   - 9:00 AM: Get ready for the day

   **Midday**
   - 10:00 AM: Work/Study block 1
   - 12:00 PM: Lunch break
   - 12:30 PM: Quick walk or break

   **Afternoon**
   - 1:00 PM: Work/Study block 2
   - 3:00 PM: Break (snack, stretching)
   - 3:30 PM: Work/Study block 3

   **Evening**
   - 5:00 PM: Wind down from work/study
   - 6:00 PM: Dinner
   - 7:00 PM: Leisure time (reading, hobbies)
   - 9:00 PM: Prepare for bed

   **Tips for a Successful Day:**
   - **Prioritize tasks:** Identify the most important tasks for the day.
   - **Take breaks:** Short breaks can improve productivity and focus.
   - **Stay flexible:** Allow some room for adjustments in case things don’t go as planned.

   Feel free to modify this template based on your actual commitments! If you have specific tasks or appointments, let me know, and I can help you organize them.
2. Prompt: What time should I leave for the airport?
   - **Result:** Deciding when to leave for the airport is important for a smooth trip. Here are some factors to consider when planning your departure time:

   **1. Flight Time**
   - Check your flight’s departure time.
   - Determine if the flight is domestic or international (international flights usually require earlier arrival).

   **2. Airport Guidelines**
   - *Domestic Flights:* Arrive at least **1.5 to 2 hours** before departure.
   - *International Flights:* Arrive at least **2 to 3 hours** before departure.

   **3. Travel Time to Airport**
   - Calculate how long it will take to get to the airport (use GPS or a maps app).
   - Consider typical traffic conditions and potential delays.

   **4. Check-In and Security**
   - Many airlines offer online check-in, which can save time.
   - Security wait times may vary, so allow extra time if you’re unsure.

   **5. Parking or Transportation**
   - If driving: Allow extra time to park and walk to the terminal.
   - If using public transportation or a ride-share: Add extra buffer time in case of unforeseen delays.

   **Summary Formula:**  
   `Total Needed Time = Required Airport Arrival Time + Travel Time + Buffer Time`

   **Example:**  
   Your flight departs at **3:00 PM**:
   - Required Arrival Time: 2 hours before (**1:00 PM**)
   - Travel Time: **30 minutes**
   - Additional Buffer Time: **30 minutes**
   - **Planned Departure:** Leave by **12:00 PM**

   **Final Tip:**  
   It’s much better to have extra time at the airport than to risk missing your flight. Safe travels! ✈️

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: my application doesn't connect to my calendar or accesses my personal flight itinerary.
